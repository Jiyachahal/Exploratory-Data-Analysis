# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a housing dataset to uncover trends and patterns. The dataset includes features such as property price, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and additional amenities. The goal is to understand the factors influencing property prices and feature distribution.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Identified and handled missing values and duplicate records.
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
  
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Generated descriptive statistics like mean, median, and percentiles.
  - Analyzed correlations between features.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Scatter plots, boxplots, and histograms to explore feature distributions and relationships.
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
  - Pie charts for categorical data visualization.

- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Detected outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

- **Sampling Techniques:**
  - Implemented systematic, stratified, and random sampling techniques.

- **Hypothesis Testing:**
  - Performed T-tests to identify significant differences between sample means and population data.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced visualizations.
- **SciPy**: Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `price`: Property price.
- `area`: Area in square feet.
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
- `stories`: Number of floors.
- Additional features such as `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `airconditioning`, and `furnishingstatus`.
